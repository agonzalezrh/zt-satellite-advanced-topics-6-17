Image mode is a new approach to operating system (OS) deployment that
lets users build, deploy, and manage Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a bootc
container image.

It reduces complexity across the enterprise by letting development,
operations, and solution providers use the same container-native tools
and techniques to manage everything from applications to the underlying
OS.

Red Hat Satellite 6.17 supports the management of RHEL image mode
systems. In this assignment, we’ll walk through the steps of registering
and updating an image mode system.

== Create a container repository in Satellite

Go to the Satellite Web UI.

You’ll need the following credentials to log into the Satellite Web UI.

You can copy and paste each of them below.

....
admin
....

....
bc31c9a6-9ff0-11ec-9587-00155d1b0702
....

Do the following: 1) Click on `+Products+`. 2) Click `+Create Product+`.

image:../assets/create-product.png[../assets/create-product]

Then we’ll create a product called `+bootc+`.

[arabic]
. Name the product `+bootc+`.

[source,text]
----
bootc
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Click on `+Save+`.

== Create an activation key for our image mode host

In this lab environment, we have a ready-built image mode host named
`+rhel2+`. We will generate an activation key and register `+rhel2+` to
the Satellite server.

Go to the Activation Keys menu.

image:../assets/activationkeys.png[../assets/activationkeys]

Click "`Create Activation Key`".

image:../assets/createactivationkey.png[../assets/createactivationkey]

Do the following to create our activation key. 1) Name the key
`+bootc-summit+`.

[source,text]
----
bootc-summit
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Click on "`Library`".
. Select the "`Default Organization View`" Content View.
. Click "`Save`".

== Register the image mode host rhel2 to Satellite

Switch to the link:tab-0[button label="`Satellite Server`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] terminal.

image:../assets/satelliteservertab.png[../assets/satelliteservertab]

From the link:tab-0[button label="`Satellite Server`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] terminal, run the following
script.

____
{empty}[!NOTE] You can automatically run the codeblocks in the terminal
in focus by clicking on `+run+`.

____

[source,bash,run]
----
export regscript=$(hammer host-registration generate-command --activation-key bootc-summit --setup-insights false --insecure true --force 1)
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" rhel2 $regscript
----

Here’s what the successful registration looks like.

== Verify image mode host details in Satellite

Let’s explore the image mode information available in Satellite.

Navigate back to the Satellite Web UI.

[arabic]
. Click on the "`Booted Container images`" menu.
. You will be able to see that one image mode host is detected. Click on
this link.

image:../assets/bootedcontainerimagehosts.png[../assets/bootedcontainerimagehosts]

Next do the following. 1) Check the box to the left of the Power button.
2) Select "`Schedule Remote Job`".

image:../assets/runremotejobrhel2.png[../assets/runremotejobrhel2]

Next we’ll create a job to check bootc status. 1) Select the "`Bootc`"
job category. 2) Select "`Bootc Status - Script Default`". 3) Click
"`Run on selected hosts`".

image:../assets/bootcstatusjob.png[../assets/bootcstatusjob]

Click on the "`rhel2.lab`" link.

image:../assets/rhel2bootcstatusjob.png[../assets/rhel2bootcstatusjob]

Here you can see lots of information about the current status of the
bootc system rhel2, including the image it was booted from.

image:../assets/bootedinfo.png[../assets/bootedinfo]

Click on "`rhel2.lab`" to get to the host menu.

image:../assets/getbacktorhel2.png[../assets/getbacktorhel2]

Click on the details tab.

image:../assets/detailstab.png[../assets/detailstab]

Scroll down to the "`Image mode details`" card.

image:../assets/runningimagehostsmenu.png[../assets/runningimagehostsmenu]

Here you can also see the "`Running image`" details which we will need
to use in the next step. This information is populated only after the
bootc status job is run or approximately every 4 hours.

== Update the container image

The container image running on `+rhel2+` is stored in a quay.io
registry. We want to modify that image. We’ll use the host `+rhel1+` to
pull down that container image from quay.io and update it.

Navigate to the link:tab-2[button label="`rhel1`" background="`#ee0000`"
color="`#c7c7c7`"] terminal.

[source,bash,run]
----
cat <<EOT > Containerfile
FROM quay.io/toharris/rhel-bootc:summit-2025
RUN echo “Welcome to Summit 2025” > /etc/motd
EOT
----

This modification will create a new message-of-the-day "`Welcome to
Summit 2025`" and will be displayed upon login.

Next, let’s build the container from the ContainerFile with the command
below.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman build -f Containerfile -t satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025
----

The command we just ran, applies the tag
`+satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025+` to our newly
built container. The tag is the name assigned to the container image in
the Satellite container registry.

== Push the new container to Satellite’s container registry

Now we’ll push the updated container image from link:tab-2[button
label="`rhel1`" background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] to the
Satellite container registry.

In the link:tab-2[button label="`rhel1`" background="`#ee0000`"
color="`#c7c7c7`"] terminal, log into Satellite container registry by
running the following command.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman login --tls-verify=false satellite.lab
----

Use the following credentials.

Admin

[source,bash,run]
----
admin
----

Password

[source,bash,run]
----
bc31c9a6-9ff0-11ec-9587-00155d1b0702
----

From `+rhel1+` we’ll push our updated container image to Satellite.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman push satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025 --tls-verify=false
----

== Enable unauthenticated pull operations for container images on Satellite

For the sake of simplicity, we want to enable unauthenticated pull for
container images.

[arabic]
. Go to the `+Lifecycle Environments+` menu.
. Click on `+Library+`.

image:../assets/lcelibrary.png[../assets/lcelibrary]

In the `+Details+` tab, do the following. 1) Check the
`+Unauthenticated Pull+` checkbox. 2) Click `+Save+`.

image:../assets/unauthpull.png[../assets/unauthpull]

== Obtain the container image label.

Go to the `+Products+` menu. Click on the `+bootc+` product.

image:../assets/bootcproduct.png[../assets/bootcproduct]

Click on `+Container Image Tags+`.

image:../assets/containerimagetags2.png[../assets/containerimagetags2]

Click on the tag `+summit-2025+`.

image:../assets/summit-2025.png[../assets/summit-2025]

Click on the `+Lifecycle Environments+` tab.

image:../assets/bootclce.png[../assets/bootclce]

Note the `+Published At+` field on the menu. We’ll need to copy and
paste this value for our next step where we run a scheduled job to tell
`+rhel2+` to use this new image.

image:../assets/publishedat.png[../assets/publishedat]

[source,text]
----
satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025
----

== Schedule a Remote Job to initiate an update of our image mode host rhel2

Let’s schedule a remote job. 1) Go to all hosts and check the box for
`+rhel2+`. 2) Click on `+Schedule Remote Job+` in the `+Select Action+`
dropdown menu.
image:../assets/runremotejobrhel2.png[../assets/runremotejobrhel2]

In the Category and template section of the Run job menu, do the
following. 1) Select the `+Bootc+` Job category. 2) Select the
`+Bootc Switch - Script Default+`. 3) Click `+Next+`.

image:../assets/bootcswitch.png[../assets/bootcswitch]

In the Target hosts and inputs section of the Run job menu, do the
following. 1) Paste the label of the updated container image in the
target field.

[source,text]
----
satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Click `+Run on selected hosts+` to initiate the job.

image:../assets/runonselected.png[../assets/runonselected]

image:../assets/successjobcompleteimagemodeswitch.png[../assets/successjobcompleteimagemodeswitch]

We will ssh into `+rhel2+` from the Satellite server. Click on the
link:tab-0[button label="`Satellite Server`" background="`#ee0000`"
color="`#c7c7c7`"] terminal and enter the following command.

[source,bash,run]
----
ssh rhel2
----

Next, check on the status of our image mode host.

[source,bash,run]
----
bootc status
----

This shows that we have a staged container image with the label
`+satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025+`. However, the
image mode host `+rhel2+`, is still booted with the old image with the
label `+quay.io/toharris/rhel-bootc:summit-2025+`.

image:../assets/bootcstatuscli.png[../assets/bootcstatuscli]

Enter the following to reboot into the new container image.

[source,bash,run]
----
reboot
----

Log back into `+rhel2+`. This may require a few attempts as it takes a
couple minutes for `+rhel2+` to boot up.

[source,bash,run]
----
ssh rhel2
----

image:../assets/welcometosummit.png[../assets/welcometosummit]

Notice that the message-of-the-day now displays
`+Welcome to Summit 2025+`.

And now check the bootc status.

[source,bash,run]
----
bootc status
----

image:../assets/updatedbootcstatus.png[../assets/updatedbootcstatus]

You can now see that the image mode host `+rhel2+` is now running our
updated image labelled
`+satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025+` and you’ll also
see that you can roll back to the previous image if required.
