Inter-Satellite Sync (ISS) export sync exports software at the
repository, content view, and lifecycle environment levels. In this
assignment, we’ll export the custom repo '`My custom repository`' at the
content view level from `+satellite.lab+` and import it into
`+satellite-2.lab+`.

== Create a new content view

In order to save time, we’ll create a new content view with a minimal
amount of software.

Copy and paste the following playbook into the link:tab-0[button
label="`Satellite Server`" background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"]
terminal.

[source,bash,run]

This playbook creates a new content view called `+ISS export+`
containing the repository `+My custom repository+`. Then the playbook
publishes and promotes the content view `+ISS Export+` to the
`+Library+` lifecycle environment.

Run the `+createandpublishissexport.yml+` playbook in the
link:tab-0[button label="`Satellite Server`" background="`#ee0000`"
color="`#c7c7c7`"] terminal.

[source,bash,run]

== Create an Inter-Satellite Sync export

Now we’ll export the content view `+ISS Export+` as an ISS export.

Copy and paste the following command into the link:tab-0[button
label="`Satellite Server`" background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"]
terminal.

[source,bash,run]
----
hammer content-export complete version --content-view "ISS Export" --version "1.0" --organization "Acme Org"
----

== Copy the exported data to satellite-2.lab

On the link:tab-0[button label="`Satellite Server`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"], you can find the exported
data in
`+/var/lib/pulp/exports/Acme_Org/Default_Organization_View/1.0/+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
ls /var/lib/pulp/exports/Acme_Org/ISS_Export/1.0/*/
----

In thelink:tab-0[button label="`Satellite Server`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] terminal run the following
command.

[source,bash,run]
----
scp -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -rp /var/lib/pulp/exports/Acme_Org/ISS_Export/1.0/*/ satellite-2.lab:/var/lib/pulp/imports/Acme_Org/
----

image:../assets/mvexportstosatellite2.png[../assets/mvexportstosatellite2]

This command will create a new directory on `+satellite-2.lab+` in
`+/var/lib/pulp/imports+` called `+Acme_Org+` and copy all the exported
data to it.

== Import the exported data into satellite-2.lab

We need to change the ownership of the data we just exported to the
`+pulp+` account and group. Switch to the link:tab-2[button
label="`Satellite Server 2`"] terminal and enter the following command.

[source,bash,run]
----
chown -R pulp:pulp /var/lib/pulp/imports/Acme_Org/
----

In the link:tab-2[button label="`Satellite Server 2`"] terminal, run the
following command.

[source,bash,run]
----
hammer content-import version --organization "Acme Org" --path "/var/lib/pulp/imports/Acme_Org"
----

You can verify the result in the web gui with the same credentials as
`+satellite.lab+`. Click on the `+Satellite 2 Web UI+`.
